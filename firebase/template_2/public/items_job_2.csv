erbh6jk,modal,"Switching to holistically-manawged animal products will actually contribute to carbon sequestration. Even the most ""sustainable"" veggie operations are still carbon-positive.","I'm surprised this is getting downvoted. I'd think that if someone was claiming a solution that I didn't know about I would at least be curious, even if it contradicted my ideologies.","I'm surprised this is getting downvoted.

It seems like there's a lot of misinformation out there about sustainable agriculture. Could you elaborate on what you mean by ""holistically-managed""? What specific practices are involved? And where can we find more information about these methods?",...I don't agree. The original post contains some factual errors and oversimplifications of complex ecological processes. It sounds like you're relying on simplistic assumptions rather than actual data from reputable sources.
es98huq,modal,Humanity just might not be up to the job of climate change. Asking it to give up the civilization and lifestyle that fossil fuels afford is like asking bacteria to stop growing at the halfway point on a petri dish.,Only thing is humanity is the highest evolved kind of life on earth and we should do better than just bacteria... Somehow,Only thing is humanity is the highest evolved kind of life on earth and we should do better than just,"...reacting instinctively to survival. We have the capacity for reason, empathy, and collective action.  We can choose sustainable solutions, transition to renewable energy, and protect our planet for future generations. It won't be easy, but it's our responsibility as intelligent beings.","...we've had thousands of years to figure this out, and what have we done? Created wars over resources, exploited each other for power, and ravaged our own planet - all while pretending to be superior to other species. This is exactly why I don't think we're capable of addressing climate change without massive external pressure. Our 'evolution' may be nothing but a myth after all.‚Äã"
gayes46,modal,"I'm hoping this won't be another Medicare for all situation where most people want it, but corporate donors don't let it happen.","Then it's up to the people to DEMAND it happen, boycott the companies.","Then it's up to the people to DEMAND it happen,",...and hold our elected officials accountable.  We need to vote for candidates who prioritize climate action and pressure those in power to pass meaningful legislation. This isn't just about individual actions; it requires collective action and political will to overcome corporate influence. We can't afford to wait any longer.,"...by organizing, voting and supporting those who actually care about the environment rather than just lining their pockets with money from oil and coal corporations. If we can get big money out of politics, then maybe we can finally start getting serious climate legislation passed. Let's do this!"
fkecvv6,modal,"When Boomer lives are at risk of coronavirus, we will destroy the global economy to help prevent disaster (as we should). When young and unborn generations are at risk of climate change, the economy is too important to make the necessary sacrifices to prevent disaster.",Except they dropped 1.5 trillion to save the market which is more important than the climate.,Except they dropped 1.5 trillion to save the market which is more,"...than double what was spent on the entire US budget for climate action over the past decade.  That's a pretty clear indication that when the ""market"" is perceived as threatened, drastic measures are taken. The hypocrisy is glaring. You can't claim the economy is too important to act on climate change while simultaneously prioritizing it above human life during a pandemic.","...$ billion in 2008 to save the Wall Street fat cats. You can't have it both ways – you either value human life or you don't. It seems when boomers are affected, all expenses paid, but for the future generations that won't exist if we don't act? How convenient! Prioritize humans over profits perhaps?"
fapi13j,modal,"Just ""talk"", a person of her status, could be standing behind Greta and rally all her billionaires friends, but a tweet is all she could managed.","Yeah reading this I couldn't handle but think ""oh give me a break"".",Yeah reading this I couldn't handle but,"...the hypocrisy. It's like they preach sustainability while living lives that are anything but. Private jets, sprawling mansions, and lavish lifestyles funded by industries destroying our planet. They talk the talk, but do they walk the walk?  It's insulting to those of us who are actually trying to make a difference. We need action, not empty gestures.","...the hypocrisy of people like Just ""talk"" makes me sick. They're just looking for ways to silence or undermine climate activists who are actually working towards real change, rather than sitting on their Twitter soapbox and shouting meaningless platitudes. Where were you when the Paris Agreement was being negotiated? When was the last time you stood up for what you believed in, outside of a social media echo chamber? Your empty virtue-signaling is pathetic....done. It's easy to critique those who do more from the comfort of your armchair. How about taking some actual action instead of pretending to care"
