    <h1>Welcome to the Missing Word Experiment!</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This study investigates how people use and understand the meanings of words in context. One important type of evidence about word meanings is peopleâ€™s ability to guess a missing word in a sentence. When Large Language Models (such as chatbots) are being trained, they also attempt to guess missing words, as a way to form useful representations of word meanings. In this experiment, we are trying to learn more about how predictable different types of words are, and how well human guesses match the guesses provided by LLMs.
