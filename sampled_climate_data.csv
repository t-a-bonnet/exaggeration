Especially because HRC did make climate change part of her agenda as SoS, such as forming the CCAC, and she has made it a central part of her campaign.

She was self-determined, straightforward, stayed focused and on-task, and was generally more mature than most of the much older people she worked with. Also, she had upper-middle class over-achieving super-smart parents to help her achieve her goals. So it really irks me when people assume that Greta is a puppet. I hope those people get a chance to actually see driven, ambitious teens at work someday, it's not that unusual, and sometimes circumstances like class and geography come together to make them successful.",Thanks for this!
